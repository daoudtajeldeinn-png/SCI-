install-nvm-node.ps1
PowerShell helper to install nvm-windows and a Node version.

Usage (run as Administrator or approve UAC prompt when installer runs):
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\app\scripts\install-nvm-node.ps1 -NodeVersion 20.19.0

This script will:
 - Download nvm-windows installer from the official GitHub latest release
 - Run the installer (UAC prompt may appear)
 - Use `nvm` to install and select the specified Node version
 - Print `node -v` and `npm -v` for verification

Note: nvm-windows requires running the installer interactively for PATH setup.
